2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Scan
3. Development Environment Setup
4. Git Commit
5. Git Branching

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

```sh
docker run --rm --name cruft python:3.9.3-alpine3.13  \
  pip3  install cruft \
  && cruft create https://github.com/rajasoun/cookiecutter-shift-left-security
```

Once finished, navigate to your new project folder :

```sh
cd <project_name>

## Toolz Radar

🚀 Tool Collection

### Adopt:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud.

1. [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft): cruft allows you to maintain all the necessary boilerplate for packaging and building projects separate from the code you intentionally write. Fully compatible with existing Cookiecutter templates
1. [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers): Leverage Docker container as a full-featured development environment.
