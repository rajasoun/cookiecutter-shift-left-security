2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Scan
3. Development Environment Setup
4. Git Commit
5. Git Branching

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

```sh
docker run --rm --name cruft python:3.9.3-alpine3.13  \
  pip3  install cruft \
  && cruft create https://github.com/rajasoun/cookiecutter-shift-left-security
