# Getting Started

Institutionalizing Shift Left Security tools for

1. Secrets Detection
1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Scan

### Prerequisites

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) ext install ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Quick Background

Visual Studo Code [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension allow us to use docker as a full-featured development environment.

Remote Containters allows us to isolate each projectâ€™s development environment with following advantages

1. Reproducibility: Each developer has exactly the same workspace
1. Isolation: Workspaces and their dependencies are isolated from each other
1. Security: Prevents malicious dependencies from installing malware or reading your files.

Each project has a .devcontainer folder.
The .devcontainer folder contains the Dockerfile and devcontainer.json configuration for the development environment.
