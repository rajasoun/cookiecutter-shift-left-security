# Purpose

Institutionalizing Shift Left Security adoption for

1.  Secrets Detection
1.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Scan
1.  Development Environment Setup
1.  Git Commit
1.  Git Branching

## Prerequisites

1.  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1.  [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) ext install ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers
1.  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Getting Started

1.  Enable help and alias

```
$ source dotfiles/.alias.sh
$ ghelp
```

1.  Setup commitzen, commitlint and ggshield toolset as git hooks

```
$ gsetup
```

1.  Populate .env file with GITHUB_TOKEN, GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY and GITGUARDIAN_API_URL

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

## Toolz Radar

ðŸš€ Tool Collection

### Adopt

1.  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud.
1.  [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter): A command-line utility that creates projects from cookiecutters (project templates)
1.  [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft): cruft allows you to maintain all the necessary boilerplate for packaging and building projects separate from the code you intentionally write. Fully compatible with existing Cookiecutter templates
1.  [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers): Leverage Docker container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set.
1.  [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli): Tool that guides the developer through the writing of the commit message
1.  [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint): Tool that validates the commit message following a set of rules and good practices
1.  [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks
1.  [gg-shield](https://github.com/GitGuardian/gg-shield): CLI application that runs in your local environment or in a CI environment to help you detect more than 200 types of secrets, as well as other potential security vulnerabilities or policy breaks.
1.  [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow): Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations

## Quick Background about Remote Containers

Visual Studo Code [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension allow us to use docker as a full-featured development environment.

Remote Containters allows us to isolate each projectâ€™s development environment with following advantages

1.  Reproducibility: Each developer has exactly the same workspace
1.  Isolation: Workspaces and their dependencies are isolated from each other
1.  Security: Prevents malicious dependencies from installing malware or reading your files.

Each project has a .devcontainer folder.
The .devcontainer folder contains the Dockerfile and devcontainer.json configuration for the development environment.
